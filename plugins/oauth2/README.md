# OAuth 2.0 for WordPress

Connect applications to your WordPress site without ever giving away your password.

This plugin uses the OAuth 2 protocol to allow delegated authorization; that is, to allow applications to access a site using a set of secondary credentials. This allows server administrators to control which applications can access the site, as well as allowing users to control which applications have access to their data.

This plugin only supports WordPress >= 4.8.

## Contributors Welcome!

This plugin works and is in use in several production environments, but the user experience and documentation could be substantially improved. We welcome input and contributions to make this tool better!
